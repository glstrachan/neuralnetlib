# neuralnetlib
neuralnetlib is a lightweight C++ library designed for performing both reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm tasks.
Neural networks are almost always obscured for beginners because of the terminology used and lack of simplistic explanations.
This library aims to make a neural network library that is very easy to use natively in C++ and requires little to no understanding of the underlying mechanics of a neural network.
